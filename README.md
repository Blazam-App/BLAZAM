## Who is it for?
* Do you manage an Active Directory environment?
* Do you want easier delegation of basic account functions?
* Do you want to easily unlock, or edit a user from your phone?
* Setting up ACL's in active directory is complicated, and at the end of the day, you're still stuck with a desktop interface.
* This app will help you enable your users.

## What is Blazam?
* Blazam is a flexible Active Directory management portal.
* The key feature is it's permissions system which allows you to empower your users to manage the groups, users, ou's, and computers you allow them to.
* Manage user group assignments, reset passwords, unlock, disable, and enable accounts.
* Configurable user creation templates to share with your users to ensure the proper information is provided.
* Manage user thumbnail photo.
* Access Active Directory recycle bin from any web browser.

## But why would I want this?
* Blazam's target audience is the IT team that wants to enable non-IT users
  to perform specific actions in Active Directory.
* Even for experienced IT administrators, the tools provided by Blazam
  not only replicate the functionality provided by Microsoft's GUI, but improve
  upon them in addition to entirely new features and functionality (like copy group memberships from another user).
* Being able to access these tools from a phone while assisting another user is another huge benefit provided. But that is
  not particular to Blazam.
* It's free.
