 Provides high-\/performance and low-\/allocating types that serialize objects to Java\+Script Object Notation (JSON) text and deserialize JSON text to objects, with UTF-\/8 support built-\/in. Also provides types to read and write JSON text encoded as UTF-\/8, and to create an in-\/memory document object model (DOM), that is read-\/only, for random access of the JSON elements within a structured view of the data.

The {\ttfamily System.\+Text.\+Json} library is built-\/in as part of the shared framework in .NET Runtime. The package can be installed when you need to use it in other target frameworks.
