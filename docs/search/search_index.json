It is designed to run under an un-privileged user account. Abstract The developers of Blazam always keep security and priviledge protection as a top priority. All password are encrypted both at rest and in transit. All incoming/outgoing connections are TLS/SSL capable. Having said that, we take no responsibillity for any damages incurred from your use of this software. You are encouraged to review the source code for yourself. Danger Running the web application under elevated priviledges exposes your Active Directory to unneccessary risk of framework exploits. The application only has as much priviledge as you supply it. It is possible to set up an advanced permission ACL within Active Directory for the user account provided for AD communication to limit the exposure of the application. Application User Danger Do not run the IIS application pool or application service as an adminstrator or System account. For IIS Use the default IIS_User account provided to the application pool. For Service Using the NetworkService account is reccomended. Folder Permissions For most deployments, no modifications to folder permissions are required. The following conditions warrant changing application root directory permissions: The user account used for application updates is not already an administrator of the web server. You want to configure a separate account to run self-updates under, if that account is not a local administrator. Encryption Note We are considering moving the private key from the %temp%\\Blazam directory to the appsettings.json The application encrypts sensitive database data such as passwords. Blazam automatically creates a random private key to use for this encryption on first launch. Private Key The privatte key in the current version is stored under %temp%\\Blazam\\writable\\security\\database.kety The temp directory is the temp directory of the running user of the application, or C:\\Windows\\Temp Backup the Private Key It is highly recommended to backup the private key immediatly following the installation wizard.

Active Directory ACL permissions are applied per OU. This means that for every OU you want a group to have access to, you have to create the exact same ACL list in each OU for that group. This is time consuming and leads to mistakes. Blazam adds a layer of abstraction to this paradigm. By including an Access Level layer between the OU permissions and the group assinged, you can create a single ACL rule an reuse it for as many groups on as many OU's as you'd like. The Access Level 's you define can be reused or coombined to create exactly the configuration you desire. Example A group HR could be given the Access Level Read Users (which allows only read access to usr demographics fields) and the Read Groups Access Level to the OU's Company/Marketing and Company/IT while also receiving Rename Users for the Company/Marketing OU as well as the Deny Group Read Access Level for the Company/IT OU. This will result in a member of HR to be able to read user demographics in Company/Marketing and Company/IT while being able to read the groups a user is a member of, only if the group is under the Company/Marketing OU. They will also be able to rename users under Company/Marketing Note Permissions that are applied inherit fully down the OU tree unless a Deny permission is set at a lower level. Groups The core element of the permission system in Blazam is the Active Directory Group. Any group added will allow the members of that group to log into the application. Nested group members are counted. Access Levels Access Levels improve upon the default permission system found in Active Directory. Name You can name your Access Levels however you'd like. Object Permissions Permissions are split between different Active Directory object types. You can set different permissions for groups from users, computers, or OU's within the same OU, or any combination therein. Field Permissions Under each object type allowed, you can choose which fields will be denied, readable, or editable. Mappings Mapping permissions is similar to default Active Directory permissions, but utilizing the powereful Acces Level component to ease and enhance the delegation process. Impersonation As a super admin, you will be able to impersonate the application experience of other users. This is extremely helpful when setting up permission to verify the access you intended.","title":"Abstract"},{"location":"permissions/abstract/#permissions-abstract","text":"Permission in Blazam differ from Active Directory in one major (and extremely helpful) way.
