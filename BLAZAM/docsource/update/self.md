# Self-Update

!!! warning

	Self-update is still very much in Alpha

The end goal is to have Blazam update itself. While progress to that goal
has been made. Further testing and optimization are required.

Attempting to update from within Blazam may or may not work properly.

For now the best way to update is to perform a [Manual Update]("update/manual.md")
