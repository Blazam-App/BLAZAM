# Automatic Updates

!!! warning

	Auto-update is still very much in Alpha

	It is not recommended to enable automatic updates at this time


!!! info 

	The end goal is to have Blazam update itself. While progress to that goal
	has been made. Further testing and optimization are required.

For now the best way to update is to perform a [Manual Update]("update/manual.md")
