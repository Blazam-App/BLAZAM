# Updates

!!! warning

	Auto-update is still very much in Alpha

	It is not recommended to enable automatic updates at this time


!!! info 

	The end goal is to have Blazam update itself. While progress to that goal
	has been made. Further testing and optimization are required.

## Application Updates

Blazam is capable of performing self-updates. You also have the option
of allowing Blazam to automatically apply updates when new versions are released.

### Branches
Updates are divided into three branches

#### Stable
This is the primary branch with the most stable versions of Blazam.

If you don't have any intentions of helping developement. This is the branch
you should use.
#### Nightly
This branch is updated at a daily pace. It may not get updated every night,
but it will include features not available in Stable, with the added risk of
application crashes and bug.

If you want to help developement, are ok with a few bugs and crashes,
but don't know how to code. This is the branch you should use.
#### Dev
This branch is updated at the most rapid pace. There may be multiple updates per day.

If you understand ASP .NET Core programming, and want to help, this is
the branch you should choose.


## Database Updates

### Minor Updates
Minor updates are applied automatically by Blazam at launch.

### Major Updates
Major updates to the database are breaking changes. 

These updates will
require the database to be re-built from scratch. 

We will provide migration tools
for this process when Blazam leaves Beta.
