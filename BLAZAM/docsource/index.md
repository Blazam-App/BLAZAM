A powerful web-based Active Directory management portal.

!!! warning "Beta Warning"

    This app is currently in beta. If you choose to install now you may
    have to reinstall from scratch in a future update.

## Summary
Blazam is a powerful, mobile-friendly, web-based Active Directory management portal.

## Requirements
* Active Directory
* Windows Host Machine (Workstation/Server)
* Well-defined OU structure

!!! warning "Sorry"

    This app is simply not designed for organizations that clump all their users into a select few OU's. 
    Having a well defined OU structure is imperitive to the operation of this application.

    Sure you can use it, but the granularity of your delegation control is proprtional to the granularity
    of your OU tree.

!!! note "Continuing"

    If you're looking for an app that delegate based on groups instead of OU's, good luck.
    The technical reality of LDAP and Active Directory prohibit any tolerable experience
    delegating groups to groups.
## Open Source
This program and the documentation are open source. Contributions are encouraged.
